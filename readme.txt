Consider an alternative post author (without creating a wordpress user as author).

== Description ==

This is a simple way of consider an alternative post author (without creating a wordpress user as author).
When you open your post, you can notice a new 'Alternative Author' metabox, with three fields: full name, link and data.
If you write an alternative author's full name, this person will appear as the author of the post instead of the person in wordpress Author metabox (and pointing to the alternative link instead of the wordpress author's page).

== Installation ==

Upload the Alternative Author plugin to your blog, Activate it. You're done!
